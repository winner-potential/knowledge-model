# Microservice Configuration Knowledge Model

Result of the consideration of configuration knowledge in a typical microservice technology stack in the form of a generalized draft for an ontology.
The question was which information is configured along the creation process of software components, e.g. microservices, and how they are related.
For example, this could be a service using NPM for dependency management, Express as middleware, Docker for deployment as a container, Docker-Compose for describing the deployment, and Gitlab-CI for describing the deployment process.
Alternatively, it could be a service using Maven for dependency management, Spring Boot as middleware, LXC scripts for deployment as containers, Ansible for describing the deployment, and Jenkins for describing the deployment process.
The resulting ontology is a first draft and makes no claim to completeness.
